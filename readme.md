This is a super_dev branch. **NOT A DEV! NOT STABLE!**

super_dev branch contains a lot of small changes and a lot of not-properly-named commits!

What to do in this branch: literally everything pertaining to the development.

Job in this version:
1. Adding application module (ready-to-use models) 
2. Fixing complex conv2d transpose
